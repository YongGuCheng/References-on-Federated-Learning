# References-on-Federated-Learning
This is the entry point for a list of references on Federated Learning (FL), a.k.a. Federated Machine Learning (FML). 
The list is available from: https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/87777798

Since it is impossible for me to know every single reference on FL, please pardon me if I missed any of your work.
If you want me to add your work to this list, you are welcome to send me a message.
I will try my best to keep this list up-to-date.
